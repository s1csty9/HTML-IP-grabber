# HTML-IP-grabber
This is just a simple HTML IP logger that I made on a whim. It gets the victim's IP and redirects them to the redirect page, it's extremely simple, all you need to do is to put in your webhook and url you want to redirect to and host the page. If you use this for illegal purposes, I didn't condone you. Have fun!
